# OLA-Bookings-Dashboard
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard using 71,000+ records of OLA ride bookings to highlight key business insights across five pages: Overall Performance, Vehicle Type, Revenue, Cancellations, and Ratings. The report helps identify trends in ride status, customer behavior, and operational efficiency for clearer, data-driven decisions.
